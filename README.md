# Bootstrap Theme for ExpressionEngine Wiki Module

[ExpressionEngine](http://ellislab.com/expressionengine/) has an available [Wiki Module](http://ellislab.com/expressionengine/user-guide/modules/wiki/) that can be optionally themed. 

This theme is based on [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/); and it's responsive to boot(strap)!

(Quickly) crafted by Zachary Lang for internal and client documentation at [Digital Additive](http://digitaladditive.com).
